# CEO Embraces AI, Slashing Customer Support Costs by 85%

Suumit Shah, the forward-thinking CEO of India-based e-commerce leader Dukaan, has showcased the future of efficient business operations by leveraging the capabilities of AI chatbots. His recent strategic shift has not only optimized the company's customer support but also led to a staggering reduction in costs.

By integrating the AI chatbot, Shah revealed a game-changing result: customer support response times were cut down from two hours to just two minutes. This swift and efficient interaction was matched with an impressive 85% reduction in customer support expenses, with monthly costs now standing at a mere $100.

While Shah's announcement on Twitter sparked a mix of reactions, the numbers speak for themselves. The massive cost savings combined with the efficiency gains underscore the revolutionary impact of AI in today's business world.

## AI: The Inevitable Future

It's worth noting that any technological transition may present initial challenges. A few users shared their adjustment experiences with the chatbot, but as AI systems evolve, they are destined to become even more responsive and intuitive.

Shah remained firm and visionary in his stance. "This is the future," he said, highlighting the inevitability of AI's growing role in business. "And at Dukaan, we're proud to be ahead of the curve."

Indeed, while there's some critique from certain quarters, Shah's decision is emblematic of a wider industry trend. Many of the world's leading tech giants are increasingly tapping into AI, ensuring they remain competitive and at the forefront of innovation.
